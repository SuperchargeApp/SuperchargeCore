# SuperchargeCore

Supercharge core libraries in a Swift Package.

## About

This is a Swift Package that provides a set of utilities for Supercharge/[Supersign](http://github.com/SuperchargeApp/Supersign) and vends a number of third-party dependencies (primarily, the [libimobiledevice](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice) constellation).

The third-party dependencies are built via [Superlibs](https://github.com/SuperchargeApp/Superlibs).

See the submodules of Superlibs for individual licenses. Note that several dependencies are LGPL licensed, which means clients must link them dynamically (this is the default behavior if you depend on SuperchargeCore.)
